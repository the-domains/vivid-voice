Studio lessons will begin again in April! I have a few slots available for casual or weekly lessons throughout the summer. I am teaching on Mondays and Tuesdays, times to be confirmend.  Lessons will be at my home studio, 2552 Legacy Ridge in Langford.

Lessons are for past students and any intermediate/advanced students and semi-pro/pro looking for audition/performance vocal coaching and technique. Musical theatre, jazz, classical, pop etc.

More info coming soon!
